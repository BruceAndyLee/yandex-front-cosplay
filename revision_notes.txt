@ No html element should be written without any class
@ don't redefine styles of elements, incline towards changing styles of classes
    e.g `a { text-decoration: none; }`
        is worse than
    `.link { text-decoration: none; }`

@ pixel perfect add-on to check your html-ing

@ use hover on link block, not as a modificator of a random element/block
@ same goes for gray-text
@ modificator naming drill: <elementName>_<modificationName>

@ currencies - same elements with different elements

@ some sections - should be navs or divs

@ use component(block) widget

@ info-cards

@ icons to be loaded via inline-svg using svg-store

@ inline styles are forbidden

@ `!important` is not to be used
